title: Allow GitHub Pull Request Only From Specific Branches
---

I have one annoyance in Visual Studio 2019 and that is pull request always seem to default to master. A lot of times I want to pull from my feature branch into develop but forget to change default in pull request. To avoid having to back out master branch I developed a GitHub JavaScript action that will check for allowed branches for pull request into given branch.

The JavaScript action was designed based off of GitHub's [Creating a JavaScript action](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action) documentation.

You simply create a new `.github/workflows/allowbranch.yml` file:
{% highlight yaml %}
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  allowed_branch_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Allowed Branch
    steps:
    # To use this repository's private action,
    # you must check out the repository
    - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Validate action step
      id: allowed-branch
      uses: cdcavell/allowed-branch-javascript-action@v1.1
      with:
        allowed-branch: 'develop'
{% endhighlight %}

Then set branch protection rules:
