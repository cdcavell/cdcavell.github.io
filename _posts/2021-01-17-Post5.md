title: Migration to Duende IdentityServer5 from IdentityServer4
---

Completed new implementation utilizing new [Duende](https://duendesoftware.com/) [IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) for OpenID Connect authentication. Very easy migration, created new project but only real change was utilizing  [Duende IdentityServer software libraries](https://github.com/duendesoftware) in place of old [IdentityServer4 software libraries](https://github.com/IdentityServer).
