title: Update: Target Framework netcoreapp3.1 to net5.0
---

Upgrade was pretty straight forward with only one gotcha. Error in GitHub CodeQL action. Autobuild was using 3.1 SDK. Added a `global.json` in root of repository and worked like a champ.
Now just need to update my Azure App Service Plan.

{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "5.0.100",
    "rollForward": "latestMajor"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
