title: Update Target Framework netcoreapp3.1 to net5.0
---

Upgrade was pretty straight forward with only one gotcha, a pull request error in GitHub CodeQL action. Autobuild was using 3.1 SDK. Added a `global.json` in root of my repository and worked like a champ.
Updated my Azure App Service Runtime Stack from .Net Core 3.1 to .Net 5 (Early Access) and [cdcavell.name](https://cdcavell.name) is now running under new .Net 5.
